# Mnemonics

### An intelligent, local-first engine for cognitive retention.

Mnemonics is a high-performance utility designed to bridge the gap between complex academic data and long-term neural encoding. By leveraging local Small Language Models (SLMs), the platform architects structured memory anchors—transforming raw information into recall-optimized hooks with zero latency and absolute privacy.

## 🔬 Core Philosophy

Traditional study methods often struggle with high-density information. Mnemonics automates the creation of phonetically stable and semantically resonant memory aids, allowing students to focus on mastery rather than rote memorization.

## ⚡ Key Features

* **Privacy-Centric Inference:** Powered by Ollama, ensuring all data remains on your local hardware.
* **Dual-Engine Logic:** Seamlessly toggle between Acronym (lexical compression) and Acrostic (narrative expansion) modes.
* **Adaptive Tone:** Fine-tune generation for Academic, Absurd, or Visceral styles to maximize mnemonic "stickiness."
* **Minimalist Workflow:** A friction-free interface designed for high-output study sessions.
